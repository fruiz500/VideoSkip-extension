# VideoSkip-extension
Same as VideoSkip, but as a Chrome/Firefox extension so it can edit videos streaming from many sources.

VideoSkip has the ability to filter out several types of objectionable content from streaming services. It can skip sections entirely, or simply mute the sound or blank the video, at user's discretion. VideoSkip runs on almost any browser and uses the Parents Guide categories from IMDB.com. Users can exchange video-specific filter settings via .skp text files formatted similarly to .vtt captions.They can also edit those settings right within the app.

VideoSkip does not infringe media copyrights because the video files are not altered in any way. Simply, users choose to see or not to see parts of the content, and the app remembers their choice. You can see in action the standalone version of VideoSkip, which works on downloaded rather than streaming videos, at https://videoskip.org/app for computers, and https://videoskip.org/mobile for mobile devices.

This is where users can get the extension, ready for installation:

Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/videoskip/

There's also a promotional page at https://videoskip.weebly.com

The VideoSkip Exchange, where users can get and contribute skip files for popular feature films, is live at https://videoskip.org/exchange

Beginning with version 0.2, VideoSkip uses localization to support multiple languages. We begin with English and Spanish, but we need your help to add other languages. Just do it and send us a pull request.
