  <h2>VideoSkip Help</h2>
<p>This extension allows you to filter out several types of objectionable content from video streams. It uses the same categories as the &quot;Parents Guide&quot; section of IMDB.com. It can skip sections entirely, or simply mute the sound or blank the video, at your discretion. There's also a standalone web app, which works with videos that you have saved to your computer. Get it at <a href="https://videoskip.org/app" target="_blank">https://videoskip.org/app</a> for a computer, or here for a mobile device: <a href="https://videoskip.org/mobile" target="_blank">https://videoskip.org/mobile</a> Skip files can be shared at the official VideoSkip Exchange, or any way you want. The exchange is at <a href="https://videoskip.org/exchange" target="_blank">https://videoskip.org/exchange</a></p>

<h2 class="helpitem">How to filter a video</h2>
<div class="helptext">
<ol>
  <li>Load the video from a streaming service normally and begin play so it loads some data, then stop it and click the VideoSkip icon on the upper-right of the browser. A new window will pop up. You can move it, or resize it like a regular page with Ctrl + or Ctrl -. </li>
  <li>If you have a .skp file containing the skips, you can load it now with the &quot;Load skip file&quot; button. Once loaded, its contents will appear in a box that becomes visible when you click &quot;Edit.&quot;</li>
  <ul>
  <li>If you don't have a skip file for the film you're watching, chances are another user has made one, and has posted it in the VideoSkip Exchange. There's a button to load the Exchange on a separate tab. You don't have to register in order to browse and download skip files.</li>
  <li>VideoSkip includes an automatic profanity filter, which is engaged by clicking the &quot;Auto prof.&quot; button after loading the skip file. You will be asked to load a subtitle file for the video, which will be scanned for words on the editable blocklist (the list is displayed at the bottom of the window when you click the &quot;Edit&quot; button). This action will not display subtitles for the video, which must be loaded from the streaming service. The overall timing of these skips can be adjusted with the arrow buttons, after checking &quot;Alt.&quot;</li>
  <li>If you want to change something in the list of skips, click &quot;Edit.&quot; There's a button to insert the current time on the video (the video itself has a scrub bar to get there), and a correctly formatted &quot;arrow&quot; if you feel lazy. There is also a button for saving your edited skip list in the default folder for downloads. Typing two slashes // in the second line of any skip disables it.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>If the picture does not look &quot;double,&quot; you are in sync and can start watching the film. If it does look &quot;double,&quot; however, you will have to scrub the video with the arrow keys that will appear, as explained in the section below, until it looks okay again. When the screenshot finally matches the video, click &quot;Sync times&quot; to sync everything and remove the superimposed screenshot.</li>
  <li>Set the category filters using the sliders, according to the audience. The higher, the more stringent the filter. High = for children, Medium = for teens, Low = for adults. If a filter is Off, the flagged content will be shown.</li>
  <li>Start the video from its own page, sit back, and enjoy. Skips will take place when their time arrives. A message will appear on the fullscreen video when you move the mouse, telling you which filters are engaged.</li>
  </ol>
<p>A number of buttons have keyboard shortcuts. Hover the mouse over each button to see what letter triggers the action. In Windows, you execute the shortcut by holding the Alt key at the same time as the letter key. In Mac OS, you must hold the Alt (Option) and Control keys at the same time as the letter key.</p>
  </div>
<h2 class="helpitem">How to sync the skips</h2>
<div class="helptext">
<ol>
  <li>If the video matches the screenshot when you click the &quot;Go to time&quot; button (visible when you click &quot;Edit&quot;), everything is in sync and you're done with this phase. Scrub the video back to the beginning and start watching.</li>
  <li>But if the video is from a source different from that used to make the sync file, there may be a mismatch. Use the arrow buttons to scrub the video until the screen matches the screenshot or description (frame by frame, if  &quot;Fine&quot; is checked). The fast forward button toggles the speed, or resumes playing if paused. You can resize the screenshot with the arrow keys, and move it around if you hold the Alt key as well. Hold Shift also for fine corrections (checking &quot;Alt&quot; and &quot;Fine&quot; do the same things).</li>
  <li>In services that allow screenshots, VideoSkip has an automatic process for finding the screenshot time by clicking the &quot;Find shot&quot; button (click &quot;Edit&quot; to see it). Make sure you are within a second of the correct time before clicking it.</li>
  <li>Click the &quot;Sync times&quot; button when video and screenshot match. This will shift all the skips by the right amount, so they will happen at the correct times. A new version of the skip file will be created so the people you share it with won't have to repeat the syncing process. </li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2 class="helpitem">Making your own skips</h2>
<div class="helptext">
<ul>
  <li>A well-constructed skip file will have a first entry  with the timing of an event near the start of the video where the image is changing quickly, plus a description of it on the line below it (do not use numbers in the description), and a screenshot. This is to allow viewers to use the skips in the file even if they are watching a video obtained from a different source, which might have a different timing. To take a screenshot, just scrub the video to the desired time and click &quot;Take screenshot&quot;; the time will be added at the current position of the cursor. If the service does not allow screenshots, a button will appear so you can load it manually. In that case, take the screenshot with the method built into the operating system (&quot;snipping tool&quot; in Windows, cmd-shit-5 in MacOS), save it to file, and then load that file into VideoSkip using the new button. If the screen contains black areas, it is best to exclude them and capture only the film proper.</li>
  <li> Each skip consists of  beginning and end times relative to the start of the video, with an arrow between them, and on the line below a category plus maybe a handling label (such as &quot;video&quot; or &quot;audio&quot;). Inserting skips is as easy as scrubbing to the point where the skip/mute/blank is supposed to begin, clicking the &quot;Insert time&quot; button on a new line, then the &quot;Insert arrow&quot; button, scrubbing to the point where the skip is to end, clicking the &quot;Insert time&quot; button once more, and then going to the next line and writing a content, number rating, and (optional) handling label. If you are initially unsure of where the skips should be inserted, there is a &quot;Fast Forward&quot; button that scrubs the video at high speed. Click it again to stop. The button to its left also stops the video. There is also an &quot;Insert silence&quot; button that inserts a retroactive single-word muting for profanity; click it as soon as you hear the word while the video plays normally.</li>
  <li>Content labels are case-insensitive. They consist of any word (actually, the first three letters are enough) of the IMDB categories, which are displayed next to the checkboxes, such as &quot;sex&quot;, &quot;nudity&quot;, &quot;gore&quot;, &quot;drugs&quot;, etc. Handling labels are these words: &quot;audio&quot;, &quot;sound&quot;, &quot;video&quot;, &quot;image&quot; (or the first three letters of each, including &quot;img&quot;) also case-insensitive.</li>
  <li>The &quot;audio&quot; or &quot;sound&quot; keywords will cause the sound to be muted during the given interval while the video is still shown, rather than skipping the section entirely, which might be useful for removing profanity. The &quot;video&quot; and &quot;image&quot; keywords cause the image to blank out while the sound still plays, which might be useful for instances of nudity, etc. No handling keyword means that the section will be completely skipped.</li>
  <li>Finally, adding a number from 1 (mild) to 3 (severe) will allow users to set the filtering level appropriately. A good standard is the following: 1 = problematic for children, 2 = problematic for teens, 3 = problematic for adults. There's a detailed rubric for what this may mean at the Videoskip Exchange. You can add explanatory text in parentheses, which won't trigger the filters.</li>
  <li>Everything is editable in the box. Use this to fine-tune timings. For instance, words to be muted typically take a lot less than a second. You can review each timing by selecting on the list and clicking &quot;Go to time&quot;. If the time is selected, the arrows will shift the time as well as scrub the video. The &quot;Insert&quot; buttons put things always at the current cursor position.</li>
  <li>Make sure there is a blank line between skips, comprising a line with times and a line with labels below it.</li>
  <li>The &quot;Save&quot; button will save your list, plus screenshot, in .skp format in your default Download folder. You will have to move it from there to the folder where you want it. This format is text-based, so you can view the file in any text editor.</li>
  <li>The &quot;VideoSkip Exchange&quot; button will open a web page where you can share your skip file with other VideoSkip users.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Sample skip, which will cause the screen to blank out from 14 minutes, 8.27 seconds from the start of the movie until 14 minutes, 14 seconds, while the sound still plays, if &quot;Sex, Nudity&quot; is set at High level. It has additional explanations that won't affect the filter:</p>
