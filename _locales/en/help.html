  <h2>VideoSkip Help</h2>
<p>This extension allows you to filter out several types of objectionable content from video streams. It uses the same categories as the "Parents Guide" section of IMDB.com. It can skip sections entirely, or simply mute the sound or blank the video, at your discretion. To get started, you need two things:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>A movie you want to edit as it streams. Please go to your favorite streaming service and rent the movie so it's ready to play (without any ads, on Amazon). The movie should be showing before you click the VideoSkip button.</li>
  <li>A skip file that tells the app what to skip and when, with extension .skp. One good source is the <strong>VideoSkip Exchange</strong> (there's a button for that), but there are other sources.</li>
</ol>
<p>Short instructions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>With the movie ready to play on your browser, click the VideoSkip button on the upper right corner of the browser. The VideoSkip interface will appear next to the video.</li>
  <li>Load a skip file for this movie using the <strong>Load skip file</strong> button.</li>
  <li>If the skip file knows your streaming source, you'll be taken to the <strong>Filter</strong> tab. Set the category filters appropriately. The higher, the more stringent the filter. A detailed description of the filtering levels appears below the sliders as you move them.</li>
  <ul>
  <li>If the streaming source is new to the skip file, you'll be taken to the <strong>Sync</strong> tab first so you can sync the skips to your streaming source. There is a detailed description of the process below.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Hide the VideoSkip interface by clicking its logo or the X on the upper left corner and continue playing the movie normally. Skips will take place when their time arrives. If you want to see it in a larger screen, connect it to the computer with a cable; do not use screen cast.</li>
</ol>
<p>Click the titles below to read more detailed instructions.</p>
<h2 class="helpitem">How to filter a video</h2>
<div class="helptext">
<ol>
  <li>Load the video from a streaming service normally and begin play so it loads some data, then stop it and click the VideoSkip icon on the upper-right of the browser. A new window will appear next to the video. You can move it, or resize it like a regular page with Ctrl + or Ctrl -. </li>
  <li>If you have a .skp file containing the skips, you can load it now with the <strong>Load skip file</strong> button in the <strong>Load</strong> tab. Once loaded, its contents will appear in a box on the <strong>Edit</strong> tab.</li>
  <ul>
  <li>If you don't have a skip file for the film you're watching, chances are another user has made one, and has posted it in the VideoSkip Exchange. There's a button to load the Exchange on a separate tab. You don't have to register in order to browse and download skip files.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>If the skip file has been previously synced with your video service, you will be taken to the <strong>Filter</strong> tab so you can set the filter strengths as described in the next step. Otherwise, you'll be taken to the <strong>Sync</strong> tab. If the picture matches the image on the tab, you are in sync and can start watching the film. If it does not, however, you will have to scrub the video with the arrow keys that will appear, as explained in the section below, until it does. You may want to superimpose the screenshot with the <strong>Superimpose</strong> button. When the screenshot finally matches the video, click <strong>Sync times</strong> to sync everything and remove the superimposed screenshot. A new version of the skip file, which will sync automatically with your video service, will be created in your Downloads folder so you can share it with others.</li>
  <li>Set the category filters using the sliders in the <strong>Filter</strong> tab, according to the audience. The higher, the more stringent. High = for children, Medium = for teens, Low = for adults. If a filter is Off, the flagged content will be shown. After this you are ready to watch.
    <ul>
      <li>VideoSkip includes an automatic profanity filter, which is engaged by clicking the  button near the bottom of this tab. You will be asked to load a subtitle file for the video, which will be scanned for words on the editable blocklist (click the description to display it or edit it). This action will not display subtitles for the video, which must be loaded from the streaming service. The overall timing of these skips can be adjusted with the arrow buttons, after checking <strong>Alt</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you want to change something in the list of skips, go to the <strong>Edit</strong> tab. There's a button to insert the current time on the video (the video itself has a scrub bar to get there), and a correctly formatted "arrow" if you feel lazy. There is also a button for saving your edited skip list in the default folder for downloads. Typing two slashes // in the second line of any skip disables it.</li>
  <li>Hide the VideoSkip window, start the video from its own page, sit back, and enjoy. Skips will take place when their time arrives. A message will appear on the fullscreen video when you move the mouse, telling you which filters are engaged.  </li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2 class="helpitem">How to sync the skips</h2>
<div class="helptext">
<ol>
  <li>If the video matches the screenshot in the <strong>Sync</strong> tab after loading the skip file, everything is in sync and you're done with this phase. Scrub the video back to the beginning and start watching.</li>
  <li>But if the video is from a source different from that used to make the sync file, there may be a mismatch. Use the arrow buttons to scrub the video until the screen matches the screenshot or description (frame by frame, if  <strong>Fine</strong> is checked). The fast forward button toggles the speed, or resumes playing if paused. You can move the screenshot with the mouse. If you hold the Alt key or check <strong>Alt</strong> it will resize.</li>
  <li>In services that allow screenshots, VideoSkip has an automatic process for finding the screenshot time by clicking the <strong>Find shot</strong> button, for services that allow taking screenshots. Make sure you are within a second of the correct time before clicking it.</li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Sync times</strong> button when video and screenshot match. This will shift all the skips by the right amount, so they will happen at the correct times. A new version of the skip file will be created so the people you share it with won't have to repeat the syncing process. </li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2 class="helpitem">Making your own skips</h2>
<div class="helptext">
<ul>
  <li>A well-constructed skip file will have a first entry  with the timing of an event near the start of the video where the image is changing quickly, plus a description of it on the line below it (do not use numbers in the description), and a screenshot. This is to allow viewers to use the skips in the file even if they are watching a video obtained from a different source, which might have a different timing. To take a screenshot, just scrub the video to the desired time and click <strong>Take screenshot</strong>; the time will be added at the current position of the cursor. If the service does not allow screenshots, a button will appear so you can load it manually. In that case, take the screenshot with the method built into the operating system ("snipping tool" in Windows, cmd-shit-5 in MacOS), save it to file, and then load that file into VideoSkip using the new button. If the screen contains black areas, it is best to exclude them and capture only the film proper.</li>
  <li> Each skip consists of  beginning and end times relative to the start of the video, with an arrow between them, and on the line below a category plus maybe a handling label (such as "video" or "audio"). Inserting skips is as easy as scrubbing to the point where the skip/mute/blank is supposed to begin, clicking the <strong>Insert time</strong> button on a new line, then the <strong>Insert arrow</strong> button, scrubbing to the point where the skip is to end, clicking the <strong>Insert time</strong> button once more, and then going to the next line and writing a content, number rating, and (optional) handling label. If you are initially unsure of where the skips should be inserted, there is a "Fast Forward" button that scrubs the video at high speed. Click it again to stop. The button to its left also stops the video. There is also an <strong>Insert silence</strong> button that inserts a retroactive single-word muting for profanity; click it as soon as you hear the word while the video plays normally.</li>
  <li>Content labels are case-insensitive. They consist of any word (actually, the first three letters are enough) of the IMDB categories, which are displayed next to the checkboxes, such as "sex", "nudity", "gore", "drugs", etc. Handling labels are these words: "audio", "sound", "video", "image", "blur", "fast" (or the first three letters of each, including "img") also case-insensitive.</li>
  <li>The "audio" or "sound" keywords will cause the sound to be muted during the given interval while the video is still shown, rather than skipping the section entirely, which might be useful for removing profanity. The "video" and "image" keywords cause the image to blank out while the sound still plays, which might be useful for instances of nudity, etc. "blur" causes the image to be blurred instead. "fast" will pass the movie in fast forward rather than skip to the end of the marked interval. No handling keyword means that the section will be completely skipped.</li>
  <li>The blanking keywords and "blur" can affect only a small portion of the screen if desired. To do this, click the "Blur box" button so make a blurred square appear on the video. Move it around with the mouse (resize by holding the Alt key also). When you are satisfied, click the "Blur pos." button to insert the exact position of the blur box into the skip, as a list of four numbers within square brackets. Bear in mind that on playback the blur box will not move during the time of that skip.</li>
  <li>Finally, adding a number from 1 (mild) to 3 (severe) will allow users to set the filtering level appropriately. A good standard is the following: 1 = problematic for children, 2 = problematic for teens, 3 = problematic for adults. There's a detailed rubric for what this may mean at the Videoskip Exchange. You can add explanatory text in parentheses, which won't trigger the filters.</li>
  <li>Everything is editable in the box. Use this to fine-tune timings. For instance, words to be muted typically take a lot less than a second. You can review each timing by selecting on the list and clicking <strong>Go to time</strong>. If the time is selected, the arrows will shift the time as well as scrub the video. The "Insert" buttons put things always at the current cursor position.</li>
  <li>Make sure there is a blank line between skips, comprising a line with times and a line with labels below it.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Save</strong> button will save your list, plus screenshot, in .skp format in your default Downloads folder. You will have to move it from there to the folder where you want it. This format is text-based, so you can view the file in any text editor.</li>
  <li>The <strong>VideoSkip Exchange</strong> button in the <strong>Load</strong> tab will open a web page where you can share your skip file with other VideoSkip users.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Sample skip, which will cause the screen to blank out from 14 minutes, 8.27 seconds from the start of the movie until 14 minutes, 14 seconds, while the sound still plays, if "Sex, Nudity" is set at High level. It has additional explanations that won't affect the filter:</p>
<p>0:14:08.27 --&gt; 0:14:14<br>
